    "Q1.1: The focus of data analysis often is how to clean it, yet, Wickham observes there is little effort put into understanding how to make data cleaning as efficient as possible, given how much time is spent doing so. She seeks to construct a framework which makes it easy and consistent to clean datasets up so that as much time can be saved as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.2: 80% of data analysis is spent on cleaning and preparing, so Wickham decides to put an end to the time waste. She introduces a concept of tidy data, a set of standards for structuring and dealing with datasets such that one can easily clean data without spending too much brain power or time. She lays out the rest of the sections and how they cover certain aspects of solving data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.3: The general ways in which data can be unclean is typically the same; mising values, repeated instances, incorrect formatting. There is typically never a novel way in which the data is messy, yet, every data set due to the lack of structure or standard, remains to be a challenge to clean because every data set has issues in their own unique ways. The second sentence makes reference to how given any particular dataset, we can understand quite easily what our observations are and what are variables are given context. Outside that context, there is really no limit to what can be a variable or observation, and due to this, cleaning data effectively and safely without harming the end result, requires structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.4: Values are any sort of numeric or categorical, and they belong to a variable or observation. Variables is some set of data points which represent the property, given some value. An observation is a set of values captured across a set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.5: Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.6: Having column headers by values, instead of variable names. Having multiple variables stored in one column. Having variables stored in both rows and columns. Having multiple types of observational units stored in the same table. Having a single observational unit stored in multiple tables. Table 4 shows income as columns, but it should be a column itself. Remake the table with 'religion', 'income', and 'frequency' as columns. This change turns column names from values into proper variables. This process is called 'melting'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.7: Table 11 shows days as columns, which isn't ideal. Table 12 fixes this by making a 'date' column. Table 12(b) separates these into their own columns, making everything a true data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1.8: The issue currently is that Wickham's implementation of tidy data is inherently coupled to the tools it is related to, and it is a standard that must be conformed to, otherwise it is not possible to achieve her form. Instead, the long term goal is to bring attention to finding new methodologies for preparing and cleaning data efficiently such that one is not reliant off the particular tools she is utilizing and promoting.\n"
